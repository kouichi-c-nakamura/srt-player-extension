"""
Build a clean, flat zip of the extension source (in the `extension/`
subfolder) for AMO / Chrome Web Store submission: manifest.json sits at the
root of the zip (no wrapping folder), and no macOS metadata (.DS_Store,
__MACOSX, ._*) is included.

Lives at the repo root, alongside the `extension/` folder. The output zip
is also written to the repo root.

Usage:
    python3 make_zip.py
    python3 make_zip.py my-custom-name.zip
